# 🦘 ASX Ticker: Technical Handover & PWA Transition Guide

This document summarizes the complete architectural state of the **ASX Ticker** (currently *ASX Watchlist Next*) to assist in moving to a new GitHub repository and transitioning to a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA).

## 🏗️ Core Architecture (The Constitution)
The application follows a **Strict MVC** pattern with a "Hardened Architecture" protocol.
*   **Controller:** `AppController.js` (The Brain). Orchestrates services, state, and UI. No functions attached to `window`.
*   **View:** Specialized renderers (`ViewRenderer.js`, `SnapshotUI.js`, `NotificationUI.js`).
*   **Model/State:** `AppState.js` (Global state) and `NotificationStore.js` (Alerts/Notifications logic).
*   **Event Bus:** Communication happens primarily via standard `CustomEvent` dispatched on the `document`.
*   **The Registry Rule:** **CRITICAL.** Magic strings are forbidden. All CSS classes, IDs, and Event names MUST be imported from `AppConstants.js`.

## 📂 Key Directory Map
*   `/main.js`: Application entry point and bootstrapper.
*   `/modules/utils/AppConstants.js`: The Single Source of Truth for the entire app.
*   `/modules/controllers/AppController.js`: Main logic orchestrator.
*   `/modules/data/DataService.js` & `AppService.js`: Firebase and Google Sheets API abstractions.
*   `/modules/state/AppState.js`: Persistence and reactive data store.
*   `/modules/ui/`: All visual components (Snapshot, Table, Modals, Sidebar).

## 📡 Data Flow & Backend
1.  **Source:** Google Sheets (`global-alerts.gs`) acts as the primary data entries and "Self-Healing" price engine.
2.  **Sync:** Script pushes data to **Firebase Realtime Database**.
3.  **Frontend:** `AppService.js` subscribes to Firebase paths.
4.  **Auth:** Firebase Google Authentication handles user identity and document namespacing.

## 📱 PWA Transition Strategy
To make this a "Fully Functional PWA":
1.  **Service Worker (`sw.js`):** Need to create a service worker in the root directory to handle:
    *   **Caching:** Store assets (`style.css`, Icons, JS modules) for offline use.
    *   **Offline Fallback:** Show the last cached data if connection is lost.
2.  **Manifest Update:** Enhance `manifest.json` with higher-resolution icons and branding for "ASX Ticker".
3.  **Registration:** Add Service Worker registration logic to `main.js`.

## 🌐 Clean URL & GitHub Transition
*   **Rename Repo:** Create the new repository as `asx-ticker`.
*   **Hosting:** Using GitHub Pages will provide a clean URL: `https://[username].github.io/asx-ticker/`.
*   **Branding:** Update `index.html` title and `AppConstants.js` strings to reflect the "ASX Ticker" name.

## 📜 Next Steps for the "New Chat" AI
When starting the new process, provide the contents of this file and mention:
> "We are moving this codebase to a new repository named `asx-ticker`. Please help me rename the branding strings, set up the Service Worker for a full PWA experience, and optimize the build for GitHub Pages deployment while maintaining the **Strict MVC** and **Registry Rule** architecture."
