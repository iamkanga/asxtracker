# ASX Tracker PWA — Configuration Template
# ============================================================
# This file documents the environment variables used by the application.
# Copy this file to `.env` and fill in your values.
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a client-side PWA. Firebase config values below are
# PUBLIC by design (they identify the Firebase project, not grant access).
# Real security comes from Firestore Security Rules + API key restrictions.
#
# See API_LOCKDOWN.md for instructions on restricting these keys
# in Google Cloud Console.
